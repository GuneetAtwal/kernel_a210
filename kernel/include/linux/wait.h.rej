+/**
+ * wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout - sleep until a condition gets true or a timeout elapses.
+ *		The condition is checked under the lock. This is expected
+ *		to be called with the lock taken.
+ * @wq: the waitqueue to wait on
+ * @condition: a C expression for the event to wait for
+ * @lock: a locked spinlock_t, which will be released before schedule()
+ *	  and reacquired afterwards.
+ * @timeout: timeout, in jiffies
+ *
+ * The process is put to sleep (TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE) until the
+ * @condition evaluates to true or signal is received. The @condition is
+ * checked each time the waitqueue @wq is woken up.
+ *
+ * wake_up() has to be called after changing any variable that could
+ * change the result of the wait condition.
+ *
+ * This is supposed to be called while holding the lock. The lock is
+ * dropped before going to sleep and is reacquired afterwards.
+ *
+ * The function returns 0 if the @timeout elapsed, -ERESTARTSYS if it
+ * was interrupted by a signal, and the remaining jiffies otherwise
+ * if the condition evaluated to true before the timeout elapsed.
